    <h1>Quality Assurance</h1>

      <h2>Ad Hoc Testing</h2>
      
      <h3>I have used Ad Hoc Testing to validate my html files through W3C html validator to check the markup validities.</h3>
      <p>Although web browsers will accept bad (invalid is the official term) web pages and do their best to render the code by making a best guess of the author’s intention, it is still possible to check whether the HTML has been written correctly, and indeed it is a good idea to do so, as you’ll see below. We call this “validating” the HTML.

        The validation program compares the HTML code in the web page with the rules of the accompanying doctype and tells you if and where those rules have been broken.</p>
      <h3>I have used assertion on my login page to check that whether the logged in user is admin or not.</h3>
      <p>So, if logged in user is not an admin then it'll return false and print error message in console.If the assertion is true, nothing gets logged to the console.</p>
      <h3>I have checked lighthouse auditing and aXe auditing to check the best practice of code.</h3>
      <p>Lighthouse is an automated tool for improving the quality of your site. You give it a URL, and it provides a list of recommendations on how to improve page performance, make pages more accessible, adhere to best practices and more. You can run it from within Chrome DevTools, as a Chrome Extension, or even as a Node module, which is useful for continuous integration.</p>
      <p>Axe Auditor is a step-by-step manual accessibility testing tool. Bring efficient and on-demand auditing capabilities to your in-house testing teams. Built on axe-core, axe Auditor offers detailed issue descriptions, remediation and expected behavior advice. Use axe Auditor as your system of record for all issues and details.</p>

      <h2>I have used GitHub for version controll this website.</h2>
      <p>Github is a web-based platform used for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Code Linting</h2>
      <p>Linting is the automated checking of your source code for programmatic and stylistic errors. This is done by using a lint tool (otherwise known as linter). A lint tool is a basic static code analyzer.</p>
      <p>Linting is important to reduce errors and improve the overall quality of your code. Using lint tools can help you accelerate development and reduce costs by finding errors earlier.</p>
      <p>Here are some linter tools</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jslint-org/jslint">JSLint</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://jshint.com/">JSHint</a></li>

      <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
      <p>UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.</p>
      <p>In SDLC, STLC, V Model, Unit testing is first level of testing done before integration testing. Unit testing is a WhiteBox testing technique that is usually performed by the developer. Though, in a practical world due to time crunch or reluctance of developers to tests, QA engineers also do unit testing.</p>

      <h2>Build Tool</h2>
      <h3>Vite build tool is used to build this site.</h3>
      <p>Vite is a build tool that significantly improves the front-end development experience. You can use Vite to set up a development environment for frameworks like Vue and React, and even for a vanilla JavaScript app with a dev server and hot reloading in just three commands.</p>
